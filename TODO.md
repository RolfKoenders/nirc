# Todo
This todo list is mostly for myself to keep track of what im doing. <br/> Next to that you can see what is in the current version ;)

- [ ] Project setup (Front & Backend setup, Build tool)
- [X] Connect to network (prototype)
- [X] Stream messages to frontend app (prototype)
- [ ] Create first layouts (To have something to work with)
- [ ] Able to connect to server through frontend (instead of always use the prototype for connecting)
- [ ] Structure project files. (Using nirc-lib, WebSocket and node-static through eachother in one file is a mess.
- [ ] Think about a theme system with Handlebars. (Just like Ghost. You can create your own theme for the frontend.

***This list will be frequently updated***
