# nirc

As a side project i want to create a [IRC](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) client as webapp. 
Im going to use [Ember](emberjs.com) for the frontend. To start with a bit of styling [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). 
The server part will be written in NodeJS. The communication between the front -and backend will be through sockets. 

## Features
Im planning to create the following features.
* Server management 
* Server console window
* Join Channels
* User list
* Private message to users
